Kaiwen Min's project for UIUC CS410: Text Information Systems.

reviews.csv contains the dataset of reviews used in the project, and model.pkl contains the best performed model: logistic regression with cross validation.

First part of the main project file contain is the preprocess of the data.
Then I used several different models for training and compared their performance with confusion matrix, the performance was evaluated with accuracy,
and logistic regression with cross validation was the best performed moedel thus selected for predicting future reviews.

The last part is the interactive part to predict future reviews.
The user can enter the review in the box and click run interact to see the prediction on the review, positive or negative.
